ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Aditya Shriwas, a passionate tech enthusiast and aspiring software engineer. Currently pursuing my studies in B Tech Computer Science. 

My programming journey began in 2021, and since then, Iâ€™ve been on an exciting learning path, honing my skills in web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm also skilled in C++ and Java programming.

Currently, I am focused on frontend technologies, but I am eager to expand my expertise and eventually transition into a full-fledged software engineer role.

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or tech discussions! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
